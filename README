Fbs - Framebuffer Boot Splash toolkit
================================================================================


Fbs is a rewrite of the old SliTaz Fbsplash tool for the SliTaz ARM and
Raspberry Pi flavor. SliTaz ARM use radically simple boot scripts so
the integration was very easy. Enabling/disabling fbsplash on boot and
managing themes can be done with the fbs utility.

In time or if someone give a hand on. It may be possible to have a
GTK or/and Ncurses frontend to handle themes.


Overview
--------

 * Use Busybox fbsplash applet for image and progress bar
 * Use Linux kernel options 'quiet' at boot time
 * Enable FBSPLASH in /etc/rcS.conf confg file
 * Tweak /etc/inittab to hide and log text messages
 * The SliTaz theme can fit in very small screen since the image
   goes top/left and have a black bg such as the Linux Framebuffer


Install & setup
---------------
Fbs is packaged for SliTaz but should work on any GNU/Linux with some
modifications to the boot scripts, patches are welcome! To install the
fbs utility and default theme: 

# make && make install

Boot splash is activated on some SliTaz ARM flavor but not on the i486
standard distibution so you need enable fbs to have a graphical boot:

# fbs on [theme]

All fbs configuration variable can be found in: /etc/rcS.conf. Thes are:

FBSPLASH="on"
FBTHEME="slitaz"

Testing
-------
Let test the environment, first make sure you have the Linux Framebuffer
device node with: 'ls /dev/fb0'. The Raspberry Pi use the Linux framebuffer
so Fbs will work out of the box.

Then press Ctrl+F2 to open a text mode session (back to X with Ctrl+F7)
and run as root the Fbs testsuite:

# fbs test

Theming
-------
Fbs provide a nifty theming mechanism designed to easily handle installed
themes as well has creating and sharing new themes. A theme consist in
a small and human readable configuration and in a gzip ppm image.

# fbs themes
# fbs set-theme [theme]
# fbs pack-theme [theme]
# fbs add-theme [theme]

Code example
------------
#!/bin/sh
#
export fifo=/tmp/fbs.fifo
fbsplash -c -f ${fifo}
	-s /usr/share/fbs/default/fbsplash.ppm \
	-i /usrshare/fbs/default/fbsplash.cfg &
 
echo 25 > ${fifo}
sleep 1
echo 50 > ${fifo}
sleep 1
echo 75 > ${fifo}
sleep 1
echo "exit" > ${fifo}
